Without a doubt, the ability to research effectively is the most important quality for a hacker to have. By its very nature, hacking requires a vast knowledge base — because how are you supposed to break into something if you don't know how it works? The thing is: no one knows everything. Everyone (professional or amateur, experienced or totally new to the subject) will encounter problems which they don't automatically know how to solve. This is where research comes in, as, in the real world, you can't ever expect to simply be handed the answers to your questions.

As your experience level increases, you will find that the things you're researching scale in their difficulty accordingly; however, in the field of information security, there will never come a point where you don't need to look things up.

This room will serve as a brief overview of some of the most important resources available to you, and will hopefully aid you in the process of building a research methodology that works for you.

We will be looking at the following topics:
• An example of a research question
• Vulnerability Searching tools
• Linux Manual Pages

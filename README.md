# Complete-Beginner
Tryhackme

The beginner path aims to give a broad introduction to the different areas in Computer Security. This path will be looking at the following areas:

Basic Linux - Get familiar with the linux command line.
Web Application Security - Learn web application security concepts through the OWASP Top 10.
Network Security - Using essential tools like NMAP to enumerate infrastructure.
Scripting Challenges - Using Python and Bash to carry out different tasks.
Privilege Escalation
Once you complete the beginner path, you should have learnt the fundamental knowledge for each specific area, and use these core concepts to build your understanding of more complex topics within the area.

Learning about hacking, even at a beginner level, requires a strong emphasis on ethical and responsible practices. It's essential to approach hacking with the right mindset, focusing on learning defensive techniques to enhance security rather than engaging in malicious activities. Here are some steps to get started:

1. Learn the Basics of Networking: Understanding the fundamentals of networking protocols, such as TCP/IP, DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS, is crucial. This knowledge forms the foundation for understanding how systems communicate and interact.

2. Study Operating Systems: Gain knowledge about common operating systems like Windows, Linux, and macOS. Learn their file systems, permissions, and basic command-line operations. This knowledge will help you understand how vulnerabilities can arise within these systems.

3. Familiarize Yourself with Programming: Learning programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or Ruby can be valuable for hacking. It will help you automate tasks, write scripts, and understand the underlying logic of applications and systems.

4. Understand Web Technologies: Gain knowledge about web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side languages like PHP, ASP.NET, or Node.js. Learn about web servers, databases, and common web vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

5. Study Security Concepts: Learn about different security concepts, including authentication, authorization, encryption, and secure coding practices. Understanding these concepts will help you identify weaknesses and implement security measures effectively.

6. Explore Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges: CTF challenges are designed to test and improve your hacking skills. These challenges provide hands-on experience in solving security-related problems and puzzles. Many online platforms host CTF challenges for beginners, such as HackTheBox, TryHackMe, and OverTheWire.

7. Engage in Responsible Hacking: Join bug bounty programs or platforms like HackerOne, Bugcrowd, or Open Bug Bounty, where you can legally report vulnerabilities in exchange for rewards. This way, you can apply your skills ethically and gain experience in a controlled environment.

8. Stay Updated: Follow reputable sources such as security blogs, forums, and online communities to stay updated on the latest vulnerabilities, techniques, and defensive measures. Being aware of current trends will help you adapt and improve your skills.

Remember, the key is to adopt an ethical mindset, respect legal boundaries, and always seek proper authorization before attempting any security testing. Ethical hacking is about securing systems, not causing harm or engaging in illegal activities.
